- `AVG()` for averages
- `COUNT(DISTINCT)` for unique value counting
- Column information queries
- Basic filtering and sorting

## File Format Support

- Matches the existing design theme
- Shares the same data context
- Consistent user experience

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **API Key Error**: Ensure your Google Gemini API key is valid
2. **File Upload Issues**: Check file format and size
3. **Query Generation Fails**: Verify the question is clear and data is loaded
4. **No Results**: Check if the data contains the columns mentioned in your question

### Performance Tips
- Large files may take longer to process
- Complex queries may require more specific questions
- Use quick actions for common operations

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the AI Chat feature:
- Save and load previous queries
- Export query results
- More advanced SQL operations
- Data visualization options
- Query history and favorites
- Batch processing for multiple files

## Support

For issues or questions about the AI Chat feature:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your API key is working
3. Ensure your file format is supported
4. Try simpler questions first
